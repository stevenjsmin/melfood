                                If the solar savings are over 100% (or brings the total savings to over 100%) you have chosen a solar system that is too large.<br> 
                                We do not recommend this due to the poor payback of the current FIT scheme. <br>
                                
                                The only time an oversized system would be recommend would be if it included a battery system to store the excess energy produced for utilisation during non-daylight hours.
